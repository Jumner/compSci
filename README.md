# compSci
#### This is a repo for my computer science work

---
### Each project will be in a folder corresponding to the language it was made in
The languages that I currently have folders for:
- C++ ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤©
- I Have to use python for probably most of CompSci ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜ª

#### Each language folder will have a hello world project as a template
Every project will be in its own folder with a date code and the name to make them easy to find

---
The main reason I did this was so I could work on the same project on multiple computers
A nice side effect is that I get to learn how to use git and github!
